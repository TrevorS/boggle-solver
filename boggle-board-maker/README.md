# Boggle Board Generator

This library contains a single function and a binary with which to
exercise it, producing a Boggle™ board suitable for play or input into
[the Boggle solver](..).  The function signature is

``` rust
fn generate_boggle_board(rows: usize, cols: usize) -> Vec<Vec<char>>
```

The binary taks a single argument, `-s` or `--size`, the format of which
in NxM, such as '4x4' or '5x5':

``` shell
$ mkboggle -s 5x5
```

The probability of letters is dictated by their distribution in the
Boggle 4x4 version of the game.  Any extra die needed are generated by
randomly duplicating as many of the the sixteen die currently
distributed with the library until the board is full.
